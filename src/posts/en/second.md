Swarm season is upon us, this time generally begins in April in the UK and continues until the bees start to shut down for the winter. 

A swarm is the bees method of reproducing, whereby a new queen is born and the old queen leaves with a portion of the hiveâ€™s population to start a new colony away from home.
