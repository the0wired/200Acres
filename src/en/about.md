An IT professional by trade, I took up beekeeping as a hobby around six years ago. After being exposed to bees and their keeping through my Dad who kept bees for many years when I was younger.

Over the past years I have continued to enjoy working with the bees and have increased from 1 hive in my back garden to 20 or so across 3 sites. 

I am a member of the British beekeepers association (BBKA) and my local association (HRBKA) who both provide support and education through my journey as a beekeeper.
